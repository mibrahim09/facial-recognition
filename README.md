Facial Recognition (ML)

I made this in my first steps into pattern recognition (Machine Learning). There are 40 different folder of images in the dataset each folder represents a face. The face has different 10 pictures, 5 are used for the model and 5 are used for testing. After the PCA there is a KNN classifier that determines the predicts the accuracy of the test data with different alphas and different k and then plots the accuracy.

The project isnt working perfectly so feel free to diagnose it.
